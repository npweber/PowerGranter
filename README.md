# PowerGranter

This is a small plugin which aims to put usefulness to the situation of being near death and faced with a hostile mob in Minecraft. If the server is running Factions and Massivecore, PowerGranter allows for a chance that killing the hostile at an HP lower than 8 (4 hearts) will grant the player Faction Power.

It's really just a nifty idea for a Factions server.
