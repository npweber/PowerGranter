PowerGranter is a small plugin which aims to put usefulness to the situation of being near death and faced with a hostile mob in Minecraft. If the server is running Factions and Massivecore, PowerGranter allows for a chance that killing the hostile at an HP lower than 8 (4 hearts) will grant the player faction power. There is nothing else that this Spigot plugin does. The plugin gives faction power upon a probability at the firing of the event where the hostile dies. It serves as a simple but interesting game mechanic for Factions, for any server that likes the concept.
